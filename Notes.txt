  1. Create a function that detects duplicate array entries
  2. Use that function on score list, match list and imported scores
  3. Import scores, ask to either overwrite or append files
      a. Overwrite should just replace
      b. Append should loop through and make sure there are no duplicates. Duplicates should prompt choice of either overwrite or skip
      c. Once complete the function delete the current rows in the tbody and replace them with the new array
  4. Save the CSV scores list to local storage
  5. Create a match list csv
